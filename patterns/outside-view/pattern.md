practitioners:
  - name: Daniel Kahneman
    era: 1934-2024
    application: Discovered the inside/outside view distinction by noticing that Israeli curriculum project teams systematically ignored base rates from comparable projects; spent his career showing that the outside view outpredicts expert intuition in nearly every domain
  - name: Bent Flyvbjerg
    era: 1952-present
    application: Applied reference class forecasting to infrastructure mega-projects (dams, tunnels, bridges, IT systems); showed that cost overruns and schedule slippage were not random but systematically predictable from the reference class — his method is now required for UK government infrastructure bids
  - name: Philip Tetlock
    era: 1954-present
    application: Ran the Good Judgment Project forecasting tournament; found that the best forecasters ("superforecasters") systematically start with base rates from the reference class before adjusting for case-specific features — a protocol he calls "outside-in"
events:
  - name: Israeli Curriculum Planning Session
    year: 1976
    gem-role: applied — Kahneman was on a committee writing a new curriculum. When he asked his expert colleague (who had completed similar projects) what fraction of such teams finished on time, the colleague said fewer than 40% and the median was 7 years. The committee's inside-view estimate was 2 years. The book was delivered 8 years later.
    practitioner: Daniel Kahneman
    outcome: Kahneman and Lovallo's 1993 paper "Timid Choices and Bold Forecasts" formalized the outside view as a debiasing technique; the Israeli curriculum incident became the founding case study for the planning fallacy concept, shaping decades of behavioral economics research and practical forecasting methodology.
  - name: Flyvbjerg's Mega-Project Audit
    year: 2003
    gem-role: applied — Flyvbjerg analyzed 258 transportation infrastructure projects across 20 countries and found that 9 out of 10 were over budget, with a mean cost overrun of 28% for rail and 45% for tunnels — systematically predictable using reference class data that planners routinely ignored
    practitioner: Bent Flyvbjerg
    outcome: Reference class forecasting became standard in major infrastructure projects; the UK government formally adopted it in 2004, improving cost estimation accuracy for public procurement across all major capital projects.
  - name: Sydney Opera House Construction
    year: 1957-1973
    gem-role: violated — Original estimate: 7 years, £3.5 million. Actual: 16 years, £51 million (14x over budget). Inside-view optimism about a novel design overwhelmed any reference to comparable large-scale public works projects
    practitioner: Jørn Utzon / NSW government
    outcome: The project became iconic but cost 14x its estimate and took more than twice as long as planned; it remains the canonical cautionary example of inside-view planning and the planning fallacy in infrastructure literature.
  - name: UK Treasury Adopts Reference Class Forecasting
    year: 2004
    gem-role: applied — Following Flyvbjerg's work and citing Kahneman's research directly, the UK Treasury mandated reference class forecasting for all major government procurement and infrastructure projects — the first government to institutionalize the outside view
    practitioner: Bent Flyvbjerg
    outcome: The UK became the first government to institutionalize the outside view, with the Green Book update requiring base-rate anchoring on comparable past projects before any adjustment; this improved cost estimate accuracy across UK infrastructure procurement.

# The Outside View

## Protocol  ← TLDR zone (always at the top)

**Trigger:** You are making a prediction, estimate, or plan — especially one where you have detailed knowledge of the specific situation and feel confident in your forecast.
**Steps:**
1. **Freeze the inside view.** Write down your current estimate or prediction. Do not refine it yet — capture the number your intuition generated from the specific features of the situation.
2. **Find the reference class.** Identify the broader category of cases yours belongs to. Not "this project" but "projects of this type." Not "this company" but "startups in this sector and stage." The class should be large enough to have meaningful statistics.
3. **Get the base rate.** Ask: what fraction of cases in this reference class achieved the outcome you're predicting? What was the median outcome? What was the distribution? Use historical data, not analogies.
4. **Anchor there first.** Your initial forecast should now be the base rate, not your inside-view estimate. Treat any adjustment upward or downward as requiring explicit justification.
5. **Adjust only for the genuinely distinctive.** For each feature of your situation that you believe makes it different from the reference class, ask: can you quantify the difference? Is the evidence for distinctiveness as strong as the base rate data? Adjust the base rate only by the amount you can defend.
6. **Compare to inside view.** Note the gap between where you ended up and where you started. If the outside view is worse, resist the urge to add it back in. The optimism is the bias, not the correction.
**Anti-pattern:** The planning fallacy — generating a confident, detailed estimate from inside-view narrative that feels realistic because it's internally coherent, while ignoring the statistical distribution of actual outcomes from comparable cases.
**Hard rule:** You may only adjust away from the base rate by an amount proportional to evidence of genuine distinctiveness — not by the vividness of your inside-view story.

## The Book  ← depth zone (always at the bottom)

### The Pattern
When people predict outcomes, they construct a narrative from the specific features of their situation — the plan, the people, the technology — and extrapolate forward. This "inside view" is coherent and feels realistic, but it systematically ignores the statistical reality of what happens to similar cases. Kahneman's defining move was to interrupt the inside-view narrative and replace it with a reference class question: *What actually happened to projects/bets/plans that looked like this one?* The outside view does not care about your plan's internal logic — it cares about the distribution of outcomes from the reference class.

### Protocol (extended)
**Step 1 — Freeze the inside view:** Before contaminating your estimate with base rates, write down what your inside-view generates. This gives you a clean read on how much the inside view biases you.

**Step 2 — Find the reference class:** The hardest step. Too narrow a class (just this type of project, in this country, in this decade) gives you too little data. Too broad (all projects ever) gives you irrelevant data. A useful class has: enough cases for statistical stability (50+), enough similarity to be analogous, and enough recency to be structurally comparable. When in doubt, go broader — you can always narrow.

**Step 3 — Get the base rate:** This often requires research. What fraction of startups at this stage reach Series B? What fraction of software projects ship on time? What fraction of M&A integrations achieve synergy targets? These numbers exist. The reason people don't use them is not that they're unavailable — it's that they're uncomfortable.

**Step 4 — Anchor on the base rate:** This is the psychological discipline. The base rate is your prior. The inside-view features are evidence you use to update. Do not average inside and outside view — anchor on the outside view and adjust. Starting from the inside view and "considering" the base rate is not the same thing.

**Step 5 — Adjust only for the genuinely distinctive:** Most perceived distinctiveness is inside-view bias in disguise. "Our team is exceptional" is inside view. "We have three domain experts versus an industry average of one" is evidence. Require the same standard of evidence for adjusting the base rate as you would for any other empirical claim.

**Step 6 — Register the gap:** If the outside view says 20% chance of success and your inside view said 80%, register that gap explicitly. Don't resolve it by splitting the difference. Acknowledge that the 80% was generated by the planning fallacy, and the 20% is the more accurate prior.

### Anti-Pattern (extended)
The planning fallacy is not carelessness — it is a structural feature of how narratives work. A plan is a story about the future. Stories are coherent and internally consistent. But the world is not internally consistent — it's full of unforeseeable events, coordination failures, and black swans that the inside-view narrative cannot model. The inside view feels realistic because it's detailed. The outside view feels pessimistic because it's statistical. Neither feeling is the evidence. The evidence is the reference class.

Common failure modes:
- **Uniqueness bias**: "Our situation is too unique to have a relevant reference class." This is almost always false. The uniqueness that matters is almost never as unique as it feels.
- **Cherry-picking the class**: Selecting a reference class that confirms the inside view. ("Other projects failed, but our reference class is the subset that had our same technology.")
- **Adding back the inside view**: After computing the outside-view estimate, adding optimistic adjustments until the number is back near the inside-view number. The adjustments should average out to near zero unless you have strong evidence of genuine distinctiveness.
- **Treating narrative logic as evidence**: "Our plan accounts for the risks that sank other projects" is an inside-view claim, not evidence of distinctiveness.

### Examples
**The Israeli Curriculum (1976):** Kahneman was part of a team designing a high-school curriculum. When he asked the team's expert (a curriculum developer who had completed many such projects) how the reference class of similar teams had fared, the expert said: fewer than 40% ever finished, the median project took 7 years, and he knew of no case that finished in the 2 years the committee was targeting. The committee finished their curriculum in 8 years. This event became the founding story for the planning fallacy concept, published in Kahneman and Tversky's 1979 paper.

**Sydney Opera House (1957–1973):** Original estimate: 7 years, £3.5 million. Final cost: £51 million, 16 years. The inside view was compelling — the design was innovative, the team talented, the government committed. The reference class for large-scale public architectural projects with novel structural engineering would have generated a far more sobering prior.

**Flyvbjerg's Infrastructure Audit (2003):** Analyzing 258 transportation projects across 20 countries, Flyvbjerg found that 86% of rail projects were over budget, with a mean overrun of 44.7%. No project planner enters the project expecting to be in the 86% — every inside view contains a narrative explaining why this project is different. The reference class doesn't care.

### Practitioners
**Daniel Kahneman (1934–2024):** The discoverer of the inside/outside view distinction. He first articulated it from the Israeli curriculum incident in the 1970s, formalized it with Amos Tversky in their 1979 work on the planning fallacy, and spent the next 40 years demonstrating that the outside view outpredicts expert intuition across medicine, finance, military assessment, and public policy. His 2011 book *Thinking, Fast and Slow* made the concept accessible to general audiences.

**Bent Flyvbjerg (1952–present):** Danish economist and professor at Oxford's Saïd Business School. Applied Kahneman's outside view directly to infrastructure mega-projects, publishing empirical audits showing that cost overruns were not random but structurally predictable from the reference class. Coined the term "reference class forecasting" and developed it into a formal methodology now required by the UK Treasury for all major government projects.

**Philip Tetlock (1954–present):** Political scientist at Penn who ran the IARPA "Good Judgment Project" forecasting tournament. Identified that "superforecasters" — people who significantly outpredict even intelligence analysts — systematically apply the outside view: they start with base rates from the reference class before adjusting for case-specific features. His 2015 book *Superforecasting* (with Dan Gardner) operationalizes the outside-in method.

### Historical Events
**Kahneman's Nobel Prize (2002):** The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded to Kahneman "for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty." The planning fallacy and the inside/outside view distinction were central to the citation. A psychologist winning the economics prize was itself an outside-view signal: the domain experts (economists) had systematically ignored the empirical reference class of actual human behavior.

**UK Treasury Mandate (2004):** The UK government's Green Book on appraisal and evaluation was updated to require reference class forecasting for major infrastructure projects, directly citing Flyvbjerg's application of Kahneman's work. The mandate specified that project cost estimates must be anchored on the historical distribution of outcomes from comparable past projects before adjustment for project-specific features.

### Lineage
Paul Meehl's 1954 book *Clinical vs. Statistical Prediction* established empirically that actuarial formulas outperform clinical expert judgment at prediction — the foundational evidence that systematic outside-view methods beat inside-view intuition. Kahneman read Meehl and built on his framework. Kahneman and Tversky formalized the inside/outside view distinction in their 1979 planning fallacy paper. Flyvbjerg operationalized it into reference class forecasting methodology in the early 2000s. Tetlock demonstrated in the Good Judgment Project that superforecasters use the outside-in method as a core discipline.

### Origin
The immediate origin is a 1976 meeting in Israel where Kahneman, then at Hebrew University, was serving on a committee designing an experimental high-school curriculum in judgment and decision-making. He asked the team's resident expert — a curriculum developer who had completed many such projects — a simple question: "When you compare our situation to other teams who have tried to write a curriculum, what fraction of them ever finished?" The expert said fewer than 40%, and that the median completion time for those who did finish was 7 years. He also said he couldn't recall a single case that had been completed in under 7 years.

Kahneman had just invented the outside view. The committee, armed with this information, voted to continue anyway — they were "inside viewing" too hard to stop. Eight years later, the curriculum was delivered.

The deeper origin is Meehl's 1954 challenge to clinical psychology: he showed that a simple actuarial formula predicting recidivism from case files outperformed experienced clinical psychologists who had interviewed the subjects. The outside view — the reference class — beats the inside view — the clinical narrative. Kahneman generalized this insight from clinical prediction to all human judgment under uncertainty.
