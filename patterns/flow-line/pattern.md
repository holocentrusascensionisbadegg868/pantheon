# Flow Line

## Protocol  ← TLDR zone (always at the top)

**Trigger:** Work moves in batches, sits idle between stages, or cycle time is dominated by waiting rather than working

**Steps:**
1. DECOMPOSE — break the operation into its smallest discrete steps; each step must be completable by one station
2. SEQUENCE — arrange steps so the product moves in one direction only, never backward, never branching
3. BRING WORK TO THE WORKER — move the product to each station; workers stay fixed, the line moves
4. SYNCHRONIZE — set one pace (takt time) across all stations; no station faster or slower than the line
5. STOP THE STALLS — walk the line; find every point where the product stops moving; eliminate or redesign that station

**Anti-pattern:** Batching — accumulating work-in-progress between stages because "it's more efficient to do them all at once." Batching hides defects, multiplies inventory, and makes cycle time unpredictable.

**Hard rule:** The product never stops moving. If it stops, that's the problem to solve — not a reason to add a buffer.

## The Book  ← depth zone (always at the bottom)

### The Pattern

Henry Ford's defining move was making the product move continuously through sequential stations so it never sits idle. Before Ford, skilled workers moved to the car and built it in place. Ford inverted this: the car moves, the workers stay fixed, and every station does exactly one operation at exactly the same pace. The result is not just speed — it's that cycle time becomes visible, predictable, and improvable.

### Protocol (extended)

**Step 1 — DECOMPOSE**
Break the full operation into the smallest steps that can be performed independently. Ford decomposed Model T assembly into 84 discrete steps. Each step must be simple enough that a single station can complete it within the takt time. If a step is too complex, split it further.

**Step 2 — SEQUENCE**
Arrange steps in strict linear order. The product moves in one direction. No step sends work backward. No branching into parallel paths unless those paths rejoin at a single synchronization point. The constraint of linearity forces you to resolve dependency conflicts upfront rather than managing them at runtime.

**Step 3 — BRING WORK TO THE WORKER**
The product moves; the worker stays fixed. This eliminates walk time, search time, and context-switching. Ford's key insight from watching Chicago meatpacking: the carcass moved on an overhead trolley past stationary butchers. He inverted it — instead of disassembly, assembly — but kept the principle: the object of work moves, the workers don't.

**Step 4 — SYNCHRONIZE**
Every station operates at the same pace: the takt time. If Station 12 takes 3 minutes and Station 13 takes 7 minutes, Station 13 is the bottleneck and the entire line runs at 7 minutes. The fix is not to speed up Station 13 — it's to split Station 13 into sub-stations that each fit within takt. No station should be faster than the line either — overproduction creates inventory, which is waste.

**Step 5 — STOP THE STALLS**
Walk the line. Anywhere the product stops moving — a pile of inventory, a worker waiting for parts, a station idle — that's the defect in your flow. Don't add a buffer to absorb the stall. Diagnose why it stalls and redesign the station or the sequence. Ford walked Highland Park obsessively, looking for stopped cars.

### Anti-Pattern (extended)

**Batching** — the belief that processing items in groups is more efficient than processing them one at a time. Batching feels efficient because each station stays busy. But it hides three costs:

1. **Inventory** — work-in-progress piles up between stations, consuming space, capital, and attention
2. **Hidden defects** — a defect in step 3 isn't discovered until step 8 processes the batch; by then, the entire batch may be bad
3. **Unpredictable cycle time** — total time from start to finish becomes a function of batch size, not work content

In software: batching manifests as "we'll deploy all features at the end of the sprint," "we'll review all PRs on Friday," or "we'll run tests after the full build." Each of these introduces delay, hides problems, and makes feedback loops longer.

### Examples

**Highland Park, 1913:** Ford's engineers installed a moving chassis assembly line powered by a chain drive. Workers stood at fixed stations. The chassis moved at a constant speed. Assembly time per car: from 12 hours 28 minutes to 1 hour 33 minutes. Within two years, Ford was producing more cars than all other manufacturers combined.

**River Rouge, 1927:** Ford extended flow to the entire supply chain. Iron ore arrived by ship, was smelted in Ford's foundry, cast into engine blocks, machined, and assembled — all in one continuous complex. A piece of iron ore became part of a finished car in 28 hours. This was flow-line thinking applied at macro scale.

**Boeing 787 (violation):** Boeing outsourced major sections to 50+ global suppliers, each working in batch mode. Sections arrived incomplete, didn't fit together, and required extensive rework. The 787 was three years late and billions over budget. The failure was architectural: they broke the flow line into disconnected batches with no synchronization.

### Practitioners

**Henry Ford (1863–1947)**
Ford did not invent the assembly line — sequential stations existed in the Venetian Arsenal (1320) and Portsmouth Block Mills (1803). Ford's contribution was making it *move*. He visited Chicago meatpacking plants in the 1900s and saw carcasses moving on overhead trolleys past stationary workers. He inverted the concept from disassembly to assembly and applied it at Highland Park in 1913. The moving line was the forcing function: it made cycle time visible, made bottlenecks obvious, and made improvement continuous.

**Taiichi Ohno (1912–1990)**
Extended Ford's flow into one-piece-flow and pull systems. Where Ford's line ran at a fixed pace set by management, Ohno let downstream demand pull work through the system. He also added the andon cord — the ability to stop the line on defect — which Ford's system lacked. Ohno acknowledged Ford as the origin: "We learned a lot from Henry Ford's system."

**Jeff Dean (1968–present)**
Applied flow-line thinking to data processing at Google. MapReduce (2004) structures computation as data flowing through map and reduce stages — no intermediate accumulation, no batching between stages. The data moves; the computation stays fixed at each stage.

### Historical Events

**Highland Park Moving Assembly Line (1913)**
Ford installed the first moving chassis assembly line on October 7, 1913. Workers resisted initially — the pace was relentless and the work monotonous. Ford responded with the $5/day wage (January 1914), more than doubling pay. Turnover dropped from 370% to 16%. The line stabilized and output exploded. By 1916, Ford produced 585,388 cars at $360 each. Flow required stability, and Ford paid for it.

**River Rouge Complex (1927)**
The Rouge was flow-line thinking taken to its logical extreme: vertical integration as continuous flow. Ford controlled every step from raw material to finished product. Critics called it megalomania. But the principle was consistent: eliminate every point where material stops moving between stages. The Rouge produced a car from raw iron ore in 28 hours.

**Boeing 787 Dreamliner (2007–2011)**
Boeing attempted a "global supply chain" model where major fuselage sections were built by suppliers worldwide and shipped to Everett, Washington for final assembly. The plan assumed batch delivery would work. It didn't — sections arrived out of sequence, incomplete, and incompatible. Boeing eventually brought much of the work back in-house. The 787 is a modern case study in what happens when you break a flow line into unsynchronized batches.

### Lineage

Venetian Arsenal (1320, sequential stations for shipbuilding — a galley per day) → Portsmouth Block Mills (1803, Marc Brunel's sequential pulley-block machines) → Chicago meatpacking disassembly lines (1860s, overhead trolley moving carcasses past fixed workers) → Ford Highland Park (1913, inversion from disassembly to assembly, adding continuous motion) → Ohno one-piece-flow (1950s, pull systems and defect-stop) → modern continuous delivery pipelines

### Origin

The earliest known sequential production system was the Venetian Arsenal, which by the 14th century could outfit a war galley in a single day by moving the hull past specialized stations — rigging, armament, provisioning — in sequence. But these were station-based, not flow-based: the hull stopped at each station.

Henry Ford's specific innovation at Highland Park in 1913 was making the product move continuously. He credited the Chicago meatpacking industry's overhead trolley system as inspiration. The key insight: when the product moves at a constant speed, every inefficiency becomes visible as a stall, and the entire system's pace is governed by its slowest station. This visibility — not the speed itself — is the true gift of the flow line.
