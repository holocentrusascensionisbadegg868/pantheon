> "Elon Musk didn't invent first principles thinking. Toyota didn't invent the factory stop. Steve Jobs didn't invent subtraction. Every modern genius is a synthesizer — standing on shoulders built across centuries of human problem-solving. Pantheon codifies those shoulders into a deployable AI library."

## What is Pantheon?

Pantheon is a library of executable cognitive patterns — distilled from history's greatest problem solvers and packaged as AI skills you can drop into any AI coding environment.

These are not quotes. Not principles. Not motivational frameworks. They are **protocols**: trigger conditions, step-by-step procedures, and anti-patterns that your AI can run when it detects the right context. History's best mental models, made executable.

Every pattern answers the same question: *what did this genius actually do differently when faced with this class of problem?*

## Install (Claude Code)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dkschrei/pantheon/main/install.sh | bash
```

Restart Claude Code after installing.

## Available Patterns

See [`PATTERNS.md`](PATTERNS.md) for the full dispatch table.

| Trigger | Pattern | Genius |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Frustration signal / repeated failure | Andon Cord | Toyota |
| Any build/automate/create request | Musk Filter | Elon Musk |
| "Why isn't this working" / stuck debugger | Feynman Clarity Test | Richard Feynman |

v0.1 — 3 of 10 patterns complete. Building in stealth. Public launch when all 10 are ready.

## Pattern Format

Every pattern follows a canonical schema: trigger conditions, protocol, anti-pattern, real examples, and origin. See [`SCHEMA.md`](SCHEMA.md).

```
patterns/
  {pattern-name}/
    pattern.md          ← canonical content (platform-agnostic)
    adapters/
      claude.md         ← Claude Code skill
      cursor.md         ← (coming) .cursorrules entry
      openai.md         ← (coming) system prompt drop-in
```

## The Stacking Demo

Same problem. Three patterns. Three different lenses.

**Problem:** "I want to build a reporting dashboard."

**`/pantheon-musk-filter`:**
→ Who specifically requires this? What breaks without it? Delete 30% of scope first.

**`/pantheon-feynman-clarity`:**
→ Explain in plain English what decision this dashboard helps make.
  If you can't answer that, you don't understand the problem yet.

**`/pantheon-andon-cord`:**
→ (If you're adding this because your team is frustrated with existing reports)
  Stop. Ask: what broke and what were you trying to accomplish?

Three useful outputs. You synthesize. You decide. This is not a prompt library — it's a council of advisors.

## Why this exists

I burned through a session's worth of Claude tokens because an agent automated a broken process instead of questioning whether the process should exist. Classic Step 5 before Step 1. I needed the Musk Filter — I just didn't have it installed anywhere.

The Andon Cord came from the same frustration: agents that see you're stuck and keep going anyway, trying variation #4 of the same failed approach. Toyota solved this problem in 1960. It's a pull cord. Anyone can use it.

The patterns in this library are not new. They have been sitting in history books, biographies, and manufacturing manuals for decades. Pantheon is the packaging. Your AI gets the shoulders of giants, available in the moment you need them.

## Status

**v1.0 — Building. Target: May 6, 2026 (Anthropic Developer Conference, SF)**

- [x] Schema v1.0 — YAML frontmatter + two-zone format (Protocol TLDR + The Book)
- [x] Andon Cord Protocol (Toyota / Taiichi Ohno)
- [x] Musk Filter (Elon Musk)
- [x] Feynman Clarity Test (Richard Feynman)
- [ ] 22-27 more gems in development via Historian agent research loop (targeted for v1.0 launch)
- [ ] Public launch + community contributions open

3-gem preview available now via install above.

## Contributing

Coming when public. For now: [open an issue](../../issues) if you have a pattern suggestion. Include the genius, the problem class, and a real example of the pattern in action.
