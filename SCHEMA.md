# Pantheon Pattern Schema

Every pattern in the Pantheon library follows this canonical format.
Pattern files live at `patterns/{name}/pattern.md`.
Platform adapters live at `patterns/{name}/adapters/{platform}.md`.

---

## pattern.md Format

Each file has two zones: **Protocol** (TLDR — always at the top) and **The Book** (depth layer — always at the bottom). Readers use whichever zone they have time for.

YAML frontmatter is required — it powers the index, the graph, and the Historian agent's merge logic.

```markdown
---
name: {pattern-slug}
aliases: [hero-name-pattern, alternate-label, historical-name]
domain: [engineering, decision-making, philosophy, leadership, creativity, systems]
trigger: [specific trigger phrase, situation, or keyword]
practitioners:
  - name: {Hero Name}
    era: {start-year}-{end-year or present}
    application: {one line — what they built or solved using this pattern}
events:
  - name: {Historical Event Name}
    year: {year or range}
    gem-role: {applied | violated} — {one line of what happened}
lineage: {origin-name} → {intermediate} → {modern-hero}
origin-earliest: {name}-{year}bc or {year}
origin-modern: {name}-{year}
origin-type: authored | historian

# {Pattern Name}

## Protocol  ← TLDR zone (always at the top)

**Trigger:** {precise condition — specific enough that a reader knows immediately whether it applies}
**Steps:**
1. {executable step — no vague advice}
2. {executable step}
3. {executable step}
**Anti-pattern:** {the specific failure mode this prevents — one sentence}
**Hard rule:** {if one exists — a line that cannot be crossed}

---

## The Book  ← depth zone (always at the bottom)

### The Pattern
{The distilled mental model in 2-3 sentences. What the genius actually does differently. Not biography — the move.}

### Protocol (extended)
{Full step-by-step with rationale for each step}

### Anti-Pattern (extended)
{What it looks like in practice when this fires wrong. Real failure modes with examples.}

### Examples
{Real incidents where this pattern applied or was violated. Specific > generic.}

### Practitioners
{Each practitioner: who they are, how they applied this gem, what they built}

### Historical Events
{Real moments in history where this gem was deployed or violated — with outcomes}

### Lineage
{The chain of transmission: origin → evolution → modern hero.
How did this idea travel through time to its most prominent practitioner?}

### Origin
{Earliest known source. Historical grounding, not hype. 1-2 paragraphs.}
```

---

## adapters/{platform}.md Format

Adapters translate the canonical pattern into platform-specific syntax.

### Claude Code Adapter (adapters/claude.md)

```markdown
---
name: {pattern-name}
description: {One sentence trigger condition — when Claude Code should invoke this skill.
             Be specific: include trigger phrases, contexts, and what the skill does.}
---

{Pattern content formatted as a Claude Code skill.
Reference the canonical pattern.md for source of truth.
Keep the protocol executable — Claude follows it step by step.}
```

---

## Rules for Pattern Authors

1. **Trigger first** — the trigger condition must be unambiguous. If a reader can't tell when to invoke it, rewrite it.
2. **Protocol beats prose** — numbered steps, not paragraphs. An agent must be able to execute it without interpretation.
3. **Anti-pattern is mandatory** — every pattern must name the failure mode it prevents. The anti-pattern is half the value.
4. **Examples must be real** — invented examples are weaker than real incidents. If you don't have one, note it as (pending) and add one when it fires.
5. **Origin is history, not hype** — cite where the pattern comes from. No hagiography.
6. **One genius, one domain** — patterns should have a clear owner and a specific problem class. Avoid patterns that "apply to everything."
